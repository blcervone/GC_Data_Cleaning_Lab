# Grand Circus - Data Set Cleaning Lab

This lab utilized pandas to evaluate and clean a broken data set. We had to remove records that had missing values, errors, or that were outliers based on an IQR test. Each step built upon the previous steps, allowing us to see how and when the data is being removed, as well as, allowing us to check our work along the way. Running counts after each cleaning step gives us a good idea whether or not the data we wanted to remove was removed correctly.
